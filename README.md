# Nepali-News-and-ML

## Introduction
This repository contains the codes that I used to perform Nepali News Classification and some other EDA tasks.

## Data
Data was scraped on different days using BeautifulSoup. [Please find this blog as the reference about how I did it](https://dataqoil.com/2021/03/20/nepali-news-annapurna-post-scrapping-using-beautifulsoup-and-python/). Or [my repository](https://github.com/iamdurga/Nepali-News-Portal-Scrapping) which contains notebooks I used.

All of the data used in this projects are available in [this drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eaZUvctC6mqK6kBxWOi5Ab-Jc5_rQBtO?usp=sharing).
